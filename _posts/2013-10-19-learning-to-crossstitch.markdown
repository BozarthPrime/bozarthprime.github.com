I was on vacation last week and as per usual I got sick on day one and spent the week sick. While this was no fun at all it did leave me with plenty of time to catch
up with some of the things I have been meaning to learn but have not had the time. One of the things I picked to give a shot was cross stitch. Why cross stitch? well, 
firstly because the gender binary is stupid and why not, secondly because I have heard it is really relaxing, and thirdly because I found a book called 
<i>Manga Cross-Stitch: Make Your Own Graphic Art Needlework</i> when I was at a Goodwill a month and how could one not want to cross stitch giant, stompy robots?
