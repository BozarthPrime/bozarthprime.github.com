In my never-ending need to laser cut game enhacements I decided today that a good way to pass the time wile I was waiting for the 3D printer to finish my parts was to cut myself a nice new copy of Werewolf. If you have not played before Werewolf or Mafia or whatever you would like to call it is a game that is currently running rampent across Kickstarter where there each player, sans the moderator, is dealt an identity at the beginnging of the game that is secret from all other players. You can be a villager, the seer, or a werewolf. The goal of the werewolves is to kill villagers and the goal of everyone else is to find the wereolves and kill them. It is great fun if you have a good group for it.
