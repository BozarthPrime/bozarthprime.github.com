Recently I backed a project on Kickstarter, as I do too often (that site is almost as dangerous as steam sales), for a small two player RPG called Doll from Josh Jordan at Ginger Goat Press. I had never heard of them before but the game piqued my interest. I will not get into all the details of the game, there is a link below for that, but suffice it to say I do not have that many story telling games, my significant other loves them, and this one looked like a lot of fun.

After the campaign ended Mr. Jordan put out a call to the backers to see if anyone would be interested in writing some music or reading for an audio version of the rules. I jumped at the opportunity because one, it has been far too long since I have had a chance to use that music degree I worked so hard to get and two, I really enjoy writing music to a subject. 

The long of it short is that I wrote some music for a fantastic story telling game that you should all check out. It will be up on Indie Press Revolution and Drivethru RPG soon so really there is no excuse not to pick it up. If you cannot wait for that you can email Ginger Goat Press at gingergoatpress@gmail.com and pick up a copy of the pdfs or audio (come on, you know which one you really want) for $4 each.
