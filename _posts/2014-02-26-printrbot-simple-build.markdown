I have been working on a full sized printer that I have been designing but it is going to be a while before that is done and even when it is it will not fit in my very tiny apartment. With tax returns coming in
and my girlfriend really starting to get into 3D printing I decided that I wanted something that I could fit on my desk not only because I want to be able to print from the comfort of my office char but also
because I know me and I will take forever to finish the other printer as I get distracted by a thousand other projects.

After quite a lot of research and deciding that I could solve my issues with a printer made of wood by just sealing the wood I went with a Printrbot Simple. We will see how it goes but I have heard many, many good things about this printer and thus far it is looking very nice, if a bit DIY which is really not a bad thing.
